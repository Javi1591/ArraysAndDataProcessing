# Java Assignment 7 – Arrays and Data Processing

A Java console application that demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, and basic data processing.  
This assignment introduces indexed data storage and iterative computation across multiple values, forming the foundation for future topics such as sorting, searching, and data structures.

## Assignment Overview

### Description
The program collects, stores, and processes a series of numeric or textual inputs using an array.  
It performs operations such as calculating totals, averages, minimums, or maximums, and displays the results in a formatted summary.  
This project reinforces array declaration, initialization, traversal, and index-based manipulation.

### Features
- Declares and initializes arrays with fixed or user-defined sizes.  
- Accepts and validates user input for each array element.  
- Uses for loops and enhanced for loops for iteration.  
- Performs calculations such as sum, average, and extremum detection.  
- Outputs neatly formatted results to the console.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how to declare, allocate, and populate arrays in Java.  
- Learn to access elements using indices and process collections of data efficiently.  
- Apply looping constructs for repetitive operations.  
- Reinforce array-based algorithmic problem solving.

### Files
- `Nazario_Assignment7.java` (example filename) — complete implementation of Assignment 7.

## Program Structure
Each program section includes:
1. Input Phase – Prompts the user for data and stores it in an array.  
2. Processing Phase – Calculates totals, averages, or comparative results using loops.  
3. Output Phase – Displays computed results with clear formatting and precision.  

All logic is modularized for readability and simplicity.
